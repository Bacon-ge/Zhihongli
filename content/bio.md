Hi, I am Zhihong, a senior student in College of Media and International Culture, Zhejiang University.

My research begins with puzzles that arise from everyday life. I often find myself wondering why people express themselves on social media in ways that feel intensely emotional, loosely reasoned, or simply noisy: why conversations escalate, why certainty hardens so quickly, and why so much of it seems to move without clear logic.

Beneath these surface impressions is a larger question that keeps pulling me back: why are they different from me? Those differences do more than frustrate or confuse me. They locate me socially, emotionally, and intellectually by revealing what I take for granted and what others do not. And it is precisely this gap that fuels my curiosity.

So you may notice that the areas I have been working on recently look wildly different: romantic relationships, fandom and affective publics, feminism in China, and more. But none of these topics are arbitrary to me. They come from the most real, persistent questions in my everyday life.

As I write and research, I am still tracing the deeper theme that connects them and figuring out the field where I truly want to plant my feet, so I keep trying.

By the way, I really, really want to raise a Shiba Inu.
